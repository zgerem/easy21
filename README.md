# Easy21 - Monte Carlo Control

This repository contains an implementation of **Monte Carlo (MC) Control** for the **Easy21** assignment from **David Silver's Reinforcement Learning course** .

Easy21 is a simplified Blackjack-like environment designed to help understand model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. 

The game involves a player and dealer drawing cards, with the goal of maximizing the playerâ€™s score while avoiding going bust.

## Results

### Optimal Value Function

![Value Function](figures/value_func_mc.png)

This shows the learned value function \( V^*(s) = \max_a Q(s, a) \) for each state after training on 1 million episodes.

### Optimal Policy

This heatmap represents the optimal policy \( \pi^*(s) = \arg\max_a Q(s, a) \). White = stick, black = hit.
